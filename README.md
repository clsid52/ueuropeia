My Software Engineering academic projects at Europeia University ðŸŽ“ ðŸ–¥ in 2014-2017 ( I haven't finished it )

I was currently taking my BSc in Software Engineering at Europeia University in Lisbon.

I use git for pretty much all of the course, but in a lot of different platforms. Now, I decided to put all together.

All of the code here is student code, so don't get your hopes up.

If you're a Software Engineering student looking at this, the projects will probably help you, or not.
